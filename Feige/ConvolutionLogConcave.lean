# Nonnegative density convolution

The closure of log-concavity under convolution is the one-dimensional case
of the Prékopa theorem.  Mathlib does not currently provide that theorem.
This file establishes its measure-theoretic convolution layer; the required
one-dimensional closure is proved by the TP2/Cauchy--Binet argument in
`Feige.TranslationTP2` and instantiated for the insertion common laws in
`Feige.FiniteSignedExp`.
