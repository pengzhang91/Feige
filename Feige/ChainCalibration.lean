# Calibrated measures on finite chains

This file formalizes the telescoping chain-calibration step used in the
proof of Theorem 2.1.  We use the sentinel convention `K (m + 1) = 0`;
consequently every chain mass, including the last one, is uniformly the
adjacent difference

`q j = K j - K (j + 1)`.

The key fact is that the mass of a terminal segment beginning at `t` is
exactly `K t`, which gives exact chain calibration whenever the rejected
states form that terminal segment.
