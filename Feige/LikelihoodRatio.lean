# Likelihood-ratio comparison for exponential convolutions

This file formalizes the four-point and double-integral parts of the local
exponential transfer step used in the proof of Theorem 2.1.  We use an
`ℝ≥0∞`-valued density so that Tonelli and monotone integration require no
auxiliary integrability assumptions.

/-- The one-dimensional four-point form of log-concavity.

For nonnegative functions on the line this is the exact multiplicative
inequality needed below.  Ordinary log-concave densities with convex
support satisfy this property by concavity of `log f`.

/-- Monotone likelihood-ratio inequality for the two shift densities.

The proof expands both products as double nonnegative integrals and
applies the four-point inequality pointwise.  Because all functions are
`ℝ≥0∞`-valued, Tonelli is unconditional.
