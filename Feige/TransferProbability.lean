# Exponential tail formulas used by the transfer identity

This file supplies the reusable one-dimensional probability calculations
behind the local exponential transfer step.  They are stated for Mathlib's
rate-one exponential measure.  In particular, the strict and non-strict
tails agree, since this measure has no atoms.
